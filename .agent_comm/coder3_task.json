GPT -5 is a novel LLM system that has been specifically marketed\ntowards oncology use. This study comprehensively benchmarks GPT -5 for the field of radiation\noncology.\nMethods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the\nAmerican College of Radiology Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021),\ncomprising 300 multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation oncologic\nvignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment indications. For the vignette\nevaluation, GPT -5 was instructed to generate structured therapeutic plans and concise two-line\nsummaries. Four board-certified radiation oncologists independently rated outputs for correctness,\ncomprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was quantified using Fleiss\u2019 \u03ba. GPT -5\nresults were compared to published GPT -3.5 and GPT -4 baselines.\nResults: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT -5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%, outperforming\nGPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were most pronounced in dose\nspecification and diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT -5\u2019s treatment recommendations were\nrated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95% CI: 3.11\u20133.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4,\n95% CI: 3.49\u20133.69). Hallucinations were rare (mean 10.0%), and no case reached majority\nconsensus for their presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss\u2019 \u03ba0.083 for correctness),\n1arXiv:2508.21777v1  [cs.CV]  29 Aug 2025\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nDinc et al. Benchmarking GPT-5 in Radiation Oncology\nreflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors clustered in complex scenarios requiring\nprecise trial knowledge or detailed clinical adaptation.\nDiscussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation oncology\nmultiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable performance in generating\nreal-world radiation oncology treatment recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for\nfurther improvement. While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors\nunderscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert oversight before\nclinical implementation.\nKeywords: GPT-5, Artificial Intelligence, Radiation Oncology, Large Language Models,\nTreatment Recommendation, Oncologic Decision Support, Hallucination, Real-World Evaluation\n1 INTRODUCTION\nLarge language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by scaling of parameters\n(1), reinforcement-learning\u2013based alignment ( 2,3), and the development of modular architectures such\nas Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) ( 4,5). These innovations have enabled broad use of LLMs across scientific\nand clinical domains ( 6,7,8). In biomedicine, domain-specific pretraining and clinical fine-tuning have\nenhanced representation of medical terminology and workflows ( 9,10,11), while general-purpose models\nhave achieved exam-level performance in several evaluations ( 12,13,14). Nonetheless, accuracy remains\nheterogeneous across specialties and problem types ( 15,16,17,18). Current consensus emphasizes\ntransparent communication of model limitations and the need for sustained human oversight (17, 18).\nWithin radiation oncology, deep learning methods are established for tasks such as segmentation, image\nenhancement, dose estimation, and outcome prediction ( 19,20,21,22,23,24,25). LLMs extend this\ntoolkit with text-centric applications such as guideline summarization, structured rationale generation,\nquestion answering, and automated documentation ( 26,27,28). Evaluation of such models now include\nphysics-focused question sets ( 29,30) as well as surgical and board-style assessments ( 31,32). Radiation\noncology-specific studies underscore both the promise of LLMs and the persistence of domain-specific\nlimitations (e.g., dose prescription, differentiation between percutaneous and interstitial techniques) as well\nas challenges in keeping pace with evolving trial evidence (16, 17).\nA key area of ongoing research is the use of large language models (LLMs) as clinical decision support\n(CDS) systems, with prominent initiatives including Med-PaLM, Med-PaLM 2, and Google AMIE\n(33,13,34). LLM agents like AMIE illustrate how LLM-based assistants may retrieve, synthesize, and\ncontextualize medical evidence for patient-specific recommendations under expert supervision ( 33). Early\nevaluations report promising accuracy in case-based reasoning and treatment planning, while underscoring\nthe necessity of explicit uncertainty handling and clinician oversight (16, 18, 35).\nGPT-5, the latest generation of OpenAI\u2019s foundation models, represents a fundamental shift compared\nto GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 by explicitly incorporating reasoning-focused reinforcement learning reward\nmodels ( 36). In combination with a larger MoE backbone and improved calibration of probabilistic\noutputs, GPT-5 achieves stronger logical consistency, longer-context reasoning, and higher factual accuracy.\nImportantly, GPT-5 is a major OpenAI model explicitly positioned as a reasoning model, designed to\ngenerate structured, interpretable rationales in addition to predictions. These advances have translated into\nimproved performance across biomedical benchmarks, USMLE-style exams, radiology case reasoning,\nFrontiers 2\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nDinc et al. Benchmarking GPT-5 in Radiation Oncology\nand oncology-specific tasks, while also reducing hallucination rates ( 37,38,17,18). Despite these\nimprovements, supervised use remains essential, particularly in high-stakes oncology settings.\nBuilding on this progress, the present work provides the first comprehensive evaluation of GPT-5 in\nradiation oncology. We investigate two complementary settings: (i) a benchmark against the American\nCollege of Radiology Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (ACR TXIT) subset using an automated\nResponses API pipeline directly comparable to GPT-3.5/4 results, and (ii) a novel real-world scenario\ndataset comprising 60 complex clinical cases without a single established standard of care (39).\nBy jointly analyzing standardized benchmarking and novel scenario-based evaluation, we assess GPT-5\u2019s\naccuracy, comprehensiveness and hallucination frequency. This dual design allows rigorous quantification\nof performance while also examining GPT-5\u2019s practical usability and failure modes in clinically ambiguous\nsituations. Given the explicit positioning of GPT-5 as a reasoning model for scientific and medical tasks,\nour study provides a timely and domain-specific benchmark of its potential and limitations in radiation\noncology.\n2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\nThis study comprised two complementary evaluations of GPT-5 in radiation oncology: (i) performance on a\nstandardized multiple-choice knowledge benchmark, and (ii) structured decision-support recommendations\non real-world oncologic case vignettes. All analyses were performed on de-identified data, using isolated\nsessions without cross-case information transfer. No protected health information was processed.\n2.1 GPT-5 model and prompting framework\nThe large language model (LLM) under test corresponds to the GPT-5 family as characterized in the\npublicly released system card ( 37). GPT-5 is a transformer-based model trained on large text corpora with\nmixture-of-experts routing and reinforcement learning from human and artifical intelligence (AI) feedback.\nFor reproducibility, standardized instructions were used for all experiments, and prompts/outputs were\nlogged. Each API call was executed in a fresh session to avoid context leakage between cases. Automation\nwas implemented in Python.\n2.2 ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination benchmark\nKnowledge-based performance was assessed using the 2021 American College of Radiology (ACR)\nRadiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT) ( 40,39), which comprises 300 multiple-choice\nquestions spanning statistics, physics, biology, and clinical radiation oncology across disease sites. Fourteen\nquestions included medical images, of which seven required visual interpretation (Q17, Q86, Q112, Q116,\nQ125, Q143, Q164). Since only GPT-5 is capable of processing image-based items, these questions were\nincluded exclusively in its evaluation. For GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, the image-based items were removed prior\nto testing, and the total number of eligible questions was adjusted accordingly, resulting in 293 scorable\nitems, consistent with prior work (39).\nQuestions were presented as stem plus options without auxiliary text. Prompts instructed the model\nto select exactly one option and return the format Final answer: X withX\u2208 {A, B, C, D }. No\nexternal tools (especially web search) or interactive feedback were permitted. Scoring followed established\nmethodology: 1.0 for a correct choice and 0.0 otherwise.\nFor content analysis, items were mapped to ACR knowledge domains and to a clinical care-path\nframework (diagnosis, treatment decision, treatment planning, prognosis, toxicity, brachytherapy, and\nFrontiers 3\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nDinc et al. Benchmarking GPT-5 in Radiation Oncology\ndosimetry) ( 40). Items explicitly referencing major clinical trials or guidelines (e.g., Stockholm III,\nCRITICS, PORTEC-3, ORIOLE, AJCC 8th edition) were flagged for subgroup reporting ( 41,42,43).\nResults were compared directly to published GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 benchmarks.\nTo assess clinical usability, we curated a set of 60 anonymized oncologic case vignettes representing a\nbroad spectrum of disease sites and treatment indications, including definitive, adjuvant, salvage, palliative,\nand reirradiation scenarios. Source cases were sampled from patients treated in 2025 and subsequently\nstripped of all identifiers. Patient name, birth date, and ID were removed automatically, while age and\nsex were retained. Clinical information such as diagnosis, stage, grading, comorbidities, and oncologic\nhistory was condensed by two physicians into vignettes, ensuring privacy while preserving clinical\nrepresentativeness.\nThe final case set was designed to be balanced across tumor sites and treatment contexts (Table 1).\nSpecifically, it included 10 brain tumor cases (glioblastoma, lower-grade glioma, meningioma, vestibular\nschwannoma, paraganglioma), 10 breast cancer cases (stratified by nodal status, recurrence, and DCIS), 10\nlung cancer cases (NSCLC stage III, SBRT, reirradiation, SCLC), 10 rectal/anal cancer cases (neoadjuvant\nrectal, definitive anal, local recurrence), 10 prostate cancer cases (risk-adapted definitive therapy,\nbiochemical recurrence, local recurrence post-prostatectomy), and 10 metastatic cases (brain, bone,\nand SBRT). This stratification allowed for evaluation of GPT-5 across both common and complex clinical\nscenarios, covering a representative cross-section of real-world radiation oncology practice.\n2.3 Real-world oncologic decision-support benchmark\nEach vignette was paired with a standardized instruction asking GPT-5 to propose a single most\nappropriate therapeutic plan and briefly justify the recommendation. Required elements included: disease\nstage, treatment intent, prior therapy, modality/technique, dose/fractionation, target volumes and OAR\nconstraints, expected toxicities, and follow-up considerations. In addition, GPT-5 was instructed to generate\na concise two-line summary of the proposed management, which was ultimately used for evaluation.\nOutputs were evaluated by four senior radiation oncologists from a tertiary university hospital. Correctness\nand comprehensiveness were rated on 4-point Likert scales (4 = fully correct / comprehensive, 1 = not\nclinically justifiable). Hallucinations were flagged per case by each reviewer (binary). For analysis, we\ncomputed the hallucination score , defined as the mean fraction of reviewers flagging a hallucination across\ncases (range 0\u20131). Consensus thresholds were summarized at levels of any ( \u22651/4 raters), majority ( \u22652/4),\nstrong ( \u22653/4), or unanimous (4/4). Inter-rater agreement was estimated using Fleiss\u2019 \u03bafor correctness,\ncomprehensiveness, and hallucination scores.\nExploratory subgroup analyses stratified cases by disease site, prior radiotherapy, and treatment intent.\nEndpoints included correctness, comprehensiveness and hallucination rate.\nBelow we provide two illustrative vignettes with GPT-5 therapy suggestions; the complete list of\nbenchmark cases is available in the Supplementary Material. Note that dates have been removed from the\npublished vignettes.\nExample 1 \u2013 Case 2 (83-year-old female)\nDiagnosis: Rectal carcinoma (5\u201311 cm from anal verge, 1 cm above linea dentata), cT4b cN2b cM0, CRM+,\nEMVI+, G2, mismatch repair\u2013proficient (pMMR).\nAnamnesis and work-up: ##.##.####: Rectoscopy with biopsy \u2192adenocarcinoma, G2, pMMR (MLH1,\nMSH2, MSH6, PMS2 intact). ##.##.####: CT chest/abdomen \u2192cT3 cN+ cM0, no distant metastases.\nFrontiers 4\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nDinc et al.

For the clinical decision-support benchmark, primary\nendpoints were expert-rated correctness, comprehensiveness, hallucinations, and concordance with\ndelivered care. Exploratory subgroup analyses were prespecified; no multiplicity adjustment was\napplied. All automation, randomization seeds, prompts, and raw outputs are provided as Supplementary\nMaterial. Use of de-identified, retrospective vignettes complied with institutional policies for research on\nnon-human-subjects data.\n3 RESULTS\n3.1 Overall TXIT performance\nAcross the 293 scorable items of the ACR TXIT (2021), previously reported baselines reproduced\nweb\u2013interface performance of 63.1% for GPT-3.5 and 74.1% for GPT-4. Using the application programming\ninterface (API) with a fixed prompt over five repeated runs, GPT-3.5 achieved 62.1%\u00b11.1%and GPT-4\n78.8%\u00b10.9%, consistent with earlier reports (39).\nFor GPT-5, we conducted five independent runs that included both text-only and image-based questions.\nOverall accuracy ranged from 92.3% to 93.0%, with a mean of 92.8%. Performance on the subset of\nimage-based items was lower, with only 2 of 7 questions answered correctly. Given that the item pool,\nscoring criteria, and adjudication procedures were identical to those used for prior models, the observed\nimprovement in accuracy reflects genuine advances in model capability rather than differences in test\nformat or evaluation methodology.\nFrontiers 5\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nDinc et al. Benchmarking GPT-5 in Radiation Oncology\n3.2 Domain-wise analysis\nStratified by ACR knowledge domains, GPT-5 preserved historical strengths, reaching at least 95%\naccuracy in Statistics, CNS/Eye, Biology, and Physics. Performance remained lower for Gynecology\n(75.0%), and moderately reduced for Gastrointestinal and Genitourinary topics (both around 90%).\nCompared with GPT-4, the largest absolute gains were observed in Dose (from 59.4% to 87.5%) and\nDiagnosis (from 76.5% to 91.2%).\n3.3 Clinical care-path analysis\nWhen mapped to clinical care-path categories, GPT-5 demonstrated consistently high accuracy:\n\u2022100% in Treatment Planning (11/11), Local Control (2/2), Diagnosis Methodology (3/3), Anatomy\n(8/8), and Pharmacology (1/1).\n\u202295.9% (47/49) in Treatment Decision and 95.2% (20/21) in Prognosis Assessment.\n\u202292.3% in Toxicity, 92.9% in Trial/Study/Guideline, and 91.2% in Diagnosis.\n\u202288.9% in Brachytherapy and 87.5% in Dose.\nOn items explicitly anchored to named trials or staging systems, GPT-5 achieved 92.9% (13/14),\noutperforming GPT-4 (85.7%) and GPT-3.5 (50.0%).\n3.4 Evaluation on clinical case vignettes\nIn the evaluation of 60 real-world radiation oncology vignettes, GPT-5\u2019s treatment recommendations\nwere rated as follows:\n\u2022Correctness: mean 3.24/4 (95% CI: 3.11\u20133.38).\n\u2022Comprehensiveness: mean 3.59/4 (95% CI: 3.49\u20133.69).\nHallucinations were infrequent. In total, 24 of 240 individual ratings (60 cases \u00d74 raters) were classified as\nhallucinations, corresponding to an overall hallucination rate of 10%. Thus, the vast majority of ratings\n(90%) did not identify hallucinations, indicating that such occurrences were infrequent across cases. No\ncase was flagged by the majority of experts (at least two out of four raters). Distribution was 36/60 (60%)\nwith zero hallucination flags and 24/60 (40%) with exactly one.\nInter-rater reliability was low, with Fleiss\u2019 \u03ba= 0.083for correctness, \u03ba=\u22120.016for comprehensiveness,\nand\u03ba=\u22120.111for hallucinations, indicating variability in individual reviewer judgments.\nWhen stratified by the six major tumor groups, distinct patterns emerged (Figures 5\u20137). Hallucinations\nwere rare overall, with prostate and brain tumor cases showing almost none, whereas breast, rectal/anal,\nlung, and metastasis cases exhibited higher variability (Figure 5). Comprehensiveness was generally\nhigh across all groups (median \u22653.5/4), with breast, prostate, and brain tumors rated most consistently\ncomplete, and rectal/anal and lung cancers showing broader variability (Figure 6). Correctness displayed\nthe clearest differentiation: prostate and brain tumors achieved the highest median scores ( \u22653.5/4), breast\nand metastases performed intermediately, while rectal/anal and lung cancers scored lowest and most\nvariably (Figure 7).\nBeyond these main groupings, more granular subgroup analyses revealed clear data-defined differences.\nHighest correctness was observed in prostate, intermediate risk (correctness 3.83; comprehensiveness 3.83;\nhallucinations 0%) and prostate, biochemical recurrence after RPE (3.67; 3.83; 0%), as well as small-cell\nFrontiers 6\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nDinc et al. Benchmarking GPT-5 in Radiation Oncology\nlung cancer (SCLC) (3.67; 4.00; 0%). Brain primaries were generally strong: meningioma (3.67; 3.67; 0%),\nvestibular schwannoma (3.67; 3.33; 0%), glioma grade 2/3 (3.50; 3.67; 0%), and glioblastoma (3.33; 3.83;\n0%); a weaker brain subgroup was pituitary adenoma (2.67; 3.50; 12.5%).\nBreast adjuvant scenarios were solid for correctness and highly complete but showed higher hallucination\nrates in several subgroups: adjuvant low risk (3.33; 4.00; 25%), adjuvant node-negative (3.50; 4.00; 25%),\nadjuvant node-positive (3.17; 3.50; 12.5%), DCIS (3.00; 3.33; 12.5%), and loco-regional recurrence (3.00;\n3.33; 0%).\nWithin lung cancer, NSCLC stage III (definitive) performed moderately (3.33; 3.44; 8.33%), whereas\nsettings requiring finer adaptation were lower: NSCLC re-irradiation (2.54; 3.50; 12.5%) and NSCLC\nSBRT (2.78; 3.22; 25%).\nFor metastatic disease, palliative bone metastases performed well (3.67; 3.89; 0%) and metastatic SBRT\nwas acceptable (3.11; 3.33; 0%), while brain metastases were lower and more error-prone (2.67; 3.33;\n18.75%).\nRectum\u2013anal cases were the weakest overall: anal cancer (3.00; 3.00; 0%), neoadjuvant rectal cancer\n(2.75; 3.25; 25%), and local recurrence (2.33; 3.56; 25%).\nThese patterns localize remaining challenges to problem settings that demand precise trial knowledge,\ndose/fractionation choices, or complex multimodality sequencing.\nSeveral representative cases illustrate these limitations:\n\u2022Case 7 (low-risk prostate cancer): The system recommended definitive therapy, which some raters\nconsidered overtreatment given active surveillance would also have been guideline-concordant, though\nothers accepted it because the patient requested therapy.\n\u2022Case 8 (neoadjuvant rectal cancer): Biomarker analysis (e.g. MSI) was omitted, a gap increasingly\nrelevant for therapy planning.\n\u2022Case 11 (brain metastases): The combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab was proposed, but with a\nnon\u2013guideline-concordant dosing scheme, lowering correctness.\n\u2022Case 17 (DCIS): A radiotherapy boost dose was recommended, which is not guideline-supported and\nwas judged overtreatment.\n\u2022Case 29 (NSCLC with SBRT): Systemic therapy options were suggested despite definitive SBRT being\nthe standard in this context.\n\u2022Case 36 (lung SBRT): Chemotherapy cycles were not specified, reducing precision despite an otherwise\nacceptable plan.\n\u2022Case 42 (brain metastases): Therapy recommendations were given without histologic confirmation, a\nprerequisite step that reduced guideline adherence.\n\u2022Case 58 (SBRT): Outdated regimens were mixed with correct ones, producing polarized ratings.\nWhere historical records permitted, GPT-5\u2019s recommendations showed high concordance with delivered\ncare across treatment intent, modality/technique, and dose/target ranges, although multiple reasonable\noptions often existed.\nFrontiers 7\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nDinc et al. Benchmarking GPT-5 in Radiation Oncology\n4 DISCUSSION\nThis work extends the literature on large language models (LLMs) in radiation oncology along two\ncomplementary axes: standardized examination performance and real-world decision support. On the\nACR TXIT subset, the present model attained 92.8% under the same item pool and adjudication rules\npreviously used for GPT -3.5/4, which yielded 63.1% and 74.1% respectively ( 39). The magnitude of this\ngain is consistent with the architectural and training changes that distinguish GPT-5 from its predecessors:\nscaling of transformer capacity, more stable long-context attention, preference optimization with richer\nfeedback, and\u2014critically\u2014its explicit positioning as a reasoning model. Unlike GPT-3.5 and GPT-4,\nGPT-5 is designed not only to recall information but to generate structured, stepwise rationales, yielding\nmore consistent and interpretable outputs ( 37,38). Our use of a constrained response format (\u201cFinal\nanswer: X\u201d) reduced adjudication noise without contributing domain knowledge. Examination accuracy\nnevertheless remains an imperfect surrogate for clinical competence: persistent weaknesses were observed\nin brachytherapy, fine-grained dosimetry, and evolving trial-specific details, mirroring deficits documented\nfor earlier models (39).\nComparisons with adjacent evaluations clarify where improvements reflect reasoning advances rather\nthan test artifacts. In radiation oncology physics, Holmes et al. showed that item structure and distractors\nmeaningfully influence performance ( 29), while Wang et al. demonstrated that simply shuffling answer\noptions alters accuracy ( 30). Our reproduction of prior TXIT baselines with identical stems, options,\nand scoring therefore supports the interpretation that GPT-5\u2019s higher scores reflect genuine advances in\nreasoning and knowledge synthesis rather than format effects. At the same time, gynecologic oncology,\nbrachytherapy, and trial-anchored items remained more challenging, consistent with topic-level variability\nin prior reports (39, 16, 15).\nA more robust and clinically relevant benchmark was established through our 60-case evaluation based\non authentic oncologic vignettes, in which GPT-5 was tasked with generating structured management plans.\nThe model produced coherent and comprehensive drafts, extending earlier findings with GPT-4 that had\nbeen reported in a smaller Red Journal\u2013style Gray Zone cases ( 39). Hallucinations were infrequent and did\nnot pose a substantive concern; rather, errors were concentrated in areas requiring detailed trial-specific\nknowledge, nuanced clinical adaptation or complex multimodality treatments (e.g., SBRT, DCIS, brain\nmetastases, ano-rectal cancer, lung cancer with comorbidities). These results highlight the potential of\nreasoning-oriented models: GPT-5 is able to synthesize case-relevant rationales, thereby moving closer to\nproviding the deliberative support that is directly applicable in tumor board settings.\nOur evaluation complements emerging work such as the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE)\nsystem, which was tested in synthetic breast oncology vignettes ( 33). While AMIE incorporated retrieval\nand self-critique pipelines and demonstrated performance above trainees and fellows, our study extends\nthis line of research by benchmarking GPT-5 on real, anonymized, multi-disease radiation oncology cases\nrated by board-certified specialists.\nOur findings align with broader medical LLM studies, which consistently show topic-level heterogeneity,\nstronger outputs under expert scaffolding, and improved interpretability when reasoning steps are made\nexplicit ( 16,15,32,31). Reviews and meta-analyses converge on supervised applications\u2014education,\ntumor-board summarization, pre-board preparation\u2014rather than autonomous decision-making ( 18,17,44).\nWithin this trajectory, GPT-5\u2019s positioning as a reasoning model represents a qualitative step: it enables\nexplicit rationale generation and structured synthesis across complex oncology cases, something prior\nmodels handled only inconsistently.\nFrontiers 8\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nDinc et al. Benchmarking GPT-5 in Radiation Oncology\nMethodologically, our study also connects to emerging multimodal planning assistants that couple LLM\nreasoning to imaging or dose engines ( 27,28). Such systems may compensate for GPT-5\u2019s current blind\nspots in image review and dosimetry but will require rigorous validation and regulatory oversight before\nclinical use ( 15,45). From a governance perspective, near-term deployment should remain supervised, with\nretrieval-augmented pipelines, auditable links to guidelines and trials (e.g., AJCC, PORTEC-3, ORIOLE),\nexplicit uncertainty labeling, and human sign-off (46, 43, 41, 42, 45).\nSeveral limitations frame the interpretation of our findings. First, standardized examinations sample\nknowledge in a manner that differs from real-world practice; thus, high TXIT performance does not\nguarantee reliability in rare, ambiguous, or evolving scenarios ( 13). Second, the retrospective case\ncohort\u2014while enriched for evaluability through follow-up and therapy verification\u2014may be affected by\nsurvivorship and documentation biases. Third, despite the use of prespecified rubrics, inter-rater variability\npersisted, typical for complex oncologic vignettes ( 17). Fourth, our evaluation did not incorporate tool use\nor external retrieval, which could plausibly further improve accuracy through real-time access to guidelines\nand trial data. Fifth, the TXIT and 60-case sets cover only a subset of radiation oncology knowledge,\nand therefore cannot capture the full diversity of clinical decision-making. Finally, model versioning,\ndecoding parameters, and chat memory constraints influence outputs; we mitigated these factors through\nfresh conversations and repeated runs, but residual variability remains.\nFuture research should prioritize prospective studies, ideally randomizing tumor-board workflows to\nmodel-assisted versus control arms. Additional directions include systematic evaluation of reasoning under\ntool use and retrieval conditions, direct comparisons of general-purpose and domain-adapted models,\nexplicit assessment of target and dose coherence as well as toxicity forecasting, and development of\nauditable retrieval pipelines tightly coupled to primary evidence ( 18). Ultimately, the goal is not to replace\nclinician judgment, but to generate reproducible, evidence-linked drafts and option sets that accelerate\nmultidisciplinary deliberation while preserving safety, accountability, and trust.\n5 LIMITATIONS\nLimitations include the absence of tool use and external retrieval, which could further improve performance\nby enabling real-time access to guidelines, trial updates, and dose\u2013constraint references. The TXIT and\n60-case sets cover only a subset of radiation oncology knowledge and therefore cannot capture the full\nspectrum of clinical decision-making. Outcomes are also influenced by model versioning, decoding\nparameters, and chat memory constraints; we mitigated these effects through fresh conversations and\nrepeated runs (five each) for GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-5, but residual variability remains.\n6 CONCLUSION\nOn TXIT benchmarks, GPT-4 outperformed GPT-3.5, and GPT-5 further increased accuracy to 92.8% ,\nwith strengths in statistics, CNS/eye, physics, diagnostic methods, and toxicity, and persistent gaps in\ngynecology, brachytherapy, dosimetry, and trial-specific details.\nMore importantly, our novel 60-case benchmark of real-world oncologic scenarios showed that GPT-5\ncan generate coherent, comprehensive management drafts. Hallucinations were rare and not a substantive\nconcern; limitations instead reflected occasional inaccuracies in guideline details, multi-modal treatments,\nand nuanced adaptation of medical knowledge to complex clinical case descriptions.\nFrontiers 9\n\n--- Page 10 ---\nDinc et al. Benchmarking GPT-5 in Radiation Oncology\nOverall, GPT-5 emerges as a reasoning model with value in supervised applications such as education,\npre-board preparation, and draft generation for tumor boards. Its near-term role is as an augmentative\nassistant, with human verification and evidence retrieval remaining essential safeguards.\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\nThe authors declare no commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict\nof interest.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nAll prompts, grading rules, and aggregated results (per-run accuracies) are shared as Supplementary\nMaterial.
